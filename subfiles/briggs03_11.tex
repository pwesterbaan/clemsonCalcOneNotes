\section{3.11: Related Rates}
  \begin{thmBox*}
    Related rates are problems that use a mathematical relationship between two or more objects under specific constraints. From this, we can differentiate this relationship and examine how each variable changes with respect to time.
  \end{thmBox*}

\begin{ex*}
  An oil rig springs a leak in calm seas and the oil spreads in a circular patch around the rig. If the radius of the oil patch increases at a rate of $30m/hr$, how fast is the area of the patch increasing when the patch has a radius of $100 m$?
\end{ex*}
\vspace*{\stretch{0.4}}
\noindent
\textbf{Solution:}

\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
    We are given the radius $r=100\,m$ which is increasing at a rate of $\frac{dr}{dt}=30\,m/hr$. First, we note the formula for the area of a circle:
  \end{minipage}
  
  \vspace*{-5pt}
  \noindent
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.65\linewidth}~
    \begin{align*}
      A&=\pi r^2\\
      \intertext{Now, we differentiate \textit{with respect to time} $t$:}
      \frac{dA}{dt}&=2\pi r\frac{dr}{dt}
    \end{align*}
  \end{minipage}%

    \end{flushright}
  \end{minipage}%
  
  \noindent
  \begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
    Note that we want to solve for $\dfrac{dA}{dt}$ --- the rate of change of the area of the oil patch:
      $$\frac{dA}{dt}=2\pi\parens{100\,m}\parens{30\,m/hr}=6000\pi\, m^2/hr$$
  \end{minipage}

\begin{ex*}
  Two small planes approach an airport, one flying due west at $120\,mi/hr$ and the other flying due north at $150\, mi/hr$. Assuming they fly at the same constant elevation, how fast is the distance between the planes changing when the westbound plane is $180\,mi$ from the airport and the northbound plane is $225\,mi$ from the airport?
\end{ex*}
\vspace*{\stretch{0.4}}
\noindent
\textbf{Solution:}

\begin{center}
%  \begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
%    Using the diagram below, we label the triangle formed between the planes and the airport such that the plane flying west is a distance of $x$ miles away from the airport, the plane flying north is $y$ miles away from the airport and the distance between the planes is $z$ miles.
%  \end{minipage}
  
  \noindent
  \begin{minipage}{0.6175\linewidth}~
  
    From the problem statement, we know that 
      \begin{align*}
        x&=180\,mi& y&=225\,mi\\
        \frac{dx}{dt}&=-120\,mi/hr& \frac{dy}{dt}&=-150\,mi/hr
      \end{align*}
      Now we use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the three sides:
      $$x^2+y^2=z^2$$
    Next, we differentiate and get the resulting relationship between the related rates:
      $$2x\,\frac{dx}{dt}+2y\,\frac{dy}{dt}=2z\,\frac{dz}{dt}$$
    Before we solve for $\frac{dz}{dt}$, we must find $z$:

      \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{../images/briggs_03_11/airplane.png}
    \end{flushright}
  \end{minipage}
  
  \vspace*{5pt}
  \noindent
  \begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
      $$z=\sqrt{180^2+225^2}=45\sqrt{4^2+5^2}=45\sqrt{41}\approx288\,mi$$
    This gives us
    \begin{align*}
      \frac{dz}{dt}
        =\frac{x\,\frac{dx}{dt}+y\,\frac{dy}{dt}}{z}
        &=\frac{\parens{180\,mi}\parens{-120\,mi/hr}+\parens{225\,mi}\parens{-150\,mi/hr}}{45\sqrt{41}\,mi}\\
        &=\frac{-1230}{\sqrt{41}}\,mi/hr\approx -192\,mi/hr
    \end{align*}

\begin{thmBox*}[Steps for Related-Rate Problems]
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Read the problem carefully, making a sketch to organize the given information. Identify the rates that are given and the rate that is to be determined.
    \item Write one or more equations that express the basic relationships among the variables.
    \item Introduce rates of change by differentiating the appropriate equation(s) with respect to time $t$.
    \item Substitute known values and solve for the desired quantity.
    \item Check that units are consistent and the answer is reasonable. (For example, does it have the correct sign?)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{thmBox*}

\textit{Note:} The \textit{Just-In-Time} book has some examples in chapter 14 that are helpful in setting up the relationships outlined in these types of word problems.

  A television camera is positioned $4000\,ft$ from the base of a rocket launching pad.  The angle of elevation of the camera has to change at the correct rate in order to keep the rocket in sight. Also the mechanism for focusing the camera has to take into account the increasing distance from the camera to the rising rocket. Assume the rocket rises vertically and its speed is $600\,ft/s$ when it has risen $3000\,ft$. How fast is the distance from the television camera to the rocket changing at that moment? Also, if the television camera is always kept aimed at the rocket, how fast is the camera’s angle of elevation changing at that same moment?
