  \begin{defn*}[Area of a Region Between Two Curves]
    Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions with $f(x)\geq g(x)$ on the interval $\sbrkt{a,b}$. The area of the region bounded by the graphs of $f$ and $g$ on $\sbrkt{a,b}$ is
      \[A=\int_a^b \parens{f(x)-g(x)}\,dx.\]
  \end{defn*}

  \begin{defn*}[Area of a Region Between Two Curves with Respect to $y$]
    Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions with $f(y)\geq g(y)$ on the interval $\sbrkt{c,d}$. The area of the region bounded by the graphs $x=f(y)$ and $x=g(y)$ on $\sbrkt{c,d}$ is
      \[A=\int_c^d \parens{f(y)-g(y)}\,dy.\]
  \end{defn*}
