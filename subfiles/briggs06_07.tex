  \begin{defn*}[Mass of a One-Dimensional Object]
    Suppose a thin bar or wire is represented by the interval $a\leq x\leq b$ with a density function $\rho$ (with units of mass per length). The \textbf{mass} of the object is
      \[m=\int_a^b \rho(x)\,dx.\]
  \end{defn*}

  \begin{defn*}[Work]
    The work done by a variable force $F$ moving an object along a line from $x=a$ to $x=b$ in the direction of the force is
      \[W=\int_a^b F(x)\,dx.\]
  \end{defn*}

  \begin{thmBox*}[Procedure: Solving Pumping Problems]
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item 
        Draw a $y$-axis in the vertical direction (parallel to gravity) and choose a convenient origin. Assume the interval $\sbrkt{a,b}$ corresponds to the vertical extent of the fluid.
      \item 
        For $a\leq y\leq b$, find the cross-sectional area $A(y)$ of the horizontal slices and the distance $D(y)$ the slices must be lifted.
      \item 
        The work required to lift the water is
          \[W=\int_a^b \rho gA(y)D(y)\,dy.\]
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{thmBox*}

  \begin{thmBox*}[Procedure: Solving Force-on-Dam Problems]
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item 
        Draw a $y$-axis on the face of the dam in the vertical direction and choose a convenient origin (often taken to be the base of the dam).
      \item 
        Find the width function $w(y)$ for each value of $y$ on the face of the dam.
      \item 
        If the base of the dam is at $y=0$ and the top of the dam is at $y=a$, then the total force on the dam is
          \[F=\int_a^b \rho g\underbrace{(a-y)}_{\textnormal{depth}}\underbrace{w(y)}_{\textnormal{width}}\,dy.\]
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{thmBox*}
